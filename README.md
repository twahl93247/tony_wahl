      <p>Hello, I'm Tony Wahl, an architectural designer with a passion for creating innovative and sustainable spaces. I hold a master's degree from the College of Architecture and Environmental Design, with a focus on historic preservation. My work combines modern design practices with an appreciation for the history and character of existing structures.</p>
      <p>With a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of architecture's impact on the environment, I strive to design spaces that are both functional and beautiful. In addition to my design skills, I am also interested in color, material, and finish (CMF) design, and I aspire to incorporate these elements into my projects.</p>
      <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio and contact me if you're interested in working together on a project.</p>
